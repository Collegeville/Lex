<a id="welcome-to-lex" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-lex" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Lex Project.</h3>

<p>Lex is dedicated to promoting and teaching effective software engineering.  You will find resources for learning the tools of software engineering, particularly focused on scientific and engineering software, C++ and Agile methodologies. Content starts with assuming some basic programming knowledge, typically what would be covered in the first year of a college computer science program.  While the content here is particularly focused on software for science, engineering and other technical fields, it can be valuable to anyone who wants to learn effective software engineering for specialized fields where deep domain knowledge is required.

<a id="agile-for-cse" class="anchor" href="#agile-for-cse" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agile for CSE</h3>

<p>Agile methodologies focus on delivering incremental value to the customer iteratively tuning the time, resources and scope to assure progress.  Agile methodologies have shown considerable value for research (science) and design (engineering) projects where precise requirements emerge as product development evolves.</p>

<a id="c-plus-plus" class="anchor" href="#c-plus-plus" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++</h3>

<p>
While Fortran is often considered the core language of scientific and engineering computing, C++ provides nearly equivalent performance advantages (if properly coded) and tremendous programmability advantanges.  In addition, C++ standards are evolving to address modern parallel programming needs, and compile-time polymorphism via template meta-programming techniques provide truly unique capabilities for generic programming that retains execution-time performance.
