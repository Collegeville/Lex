            <h3>Software Debugging</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Error, fault, failure:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Error: misunderstanding or misconceptions of programmers.</li>
                        <li>Fault (also called bug): The incorrect code.</li>
                        <li>Failure: The observable incorrect behavior of the software.</li>
                        <li>Error causes fault, fault causes failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Debugging approaches: Once we have failure, we need to find a solution
                    <ul>
                        <li>Testing: run some input domain and compare the result to the expected output domain.</li>
                        <li>Static verification: similar to testing but you have to test all imput domain.</li>
                        <li>Inspection: Look at the code again to find any mistake.</li>
                        <li>Formal proof of correctness: proof to verify the expected result from the program.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>White-box testing:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Refactoring is a process of rewriting your program</li>
                        <li>Refactoring makes the code more understandable, reduces unnecessary code, adds comments, and alleviates the maintenance process</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>Agile characteristics:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agile uses the iterative approach</li>
                    <li>Each member is important for the project</li>
                    <li>Customers may also involve in the project</li>
                    <li>Requirements sometimes may change</li>
                    <li>Project is developed in a simple, but creative way</li>
                    <li>Communication plays a crucial role in the project</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Extreme programming:</li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme programming</a> (also called XP)
                is a popular agile method.
                Practicing XP with the following steps:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Incremental planning:</em> Have a careful plan to transform users requirement into appropriate software.</li>
                    <li><em>Small release</em>: Release small parts with frequently changes to avoid time-wasting</li>
                    <li><em>Simple design</em>: Design with as fewest methods and classes as possible </li>
                    <li><em>Test first</em>: Unit Testing software is required</li>
                    <li><em>Refactoring</em>: Refactoring make code readable and maintainable, which saves time and money</li>
                    <li><em>Pair programming</em>: Two people working together can develop more reliable sotware products</li>
                    <li><em>Continuous integration</em>: Integrate software every few hours to avoid uncontrollable software bugs</li>
                    <li><em>On-site customers</em>: Customers are part of the team.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Scrum:</li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> is another popular agile method.
                A scrum team often contains product owner, development team and scrum master. <br>
